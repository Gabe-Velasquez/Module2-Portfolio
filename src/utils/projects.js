This user-friendly interface not only swiftly returns the image with marked facial coordinates but also includes robust security features through integrated sign-in and registration functions. This project was brought to life through the utilization of a powerful technology stack, featuring React for the frontend, Node for the backend, and Postgres for data management. To ensure seamless deployment and hosting, I harnessed the capabilities of Render.com, further enhancing the application's reliability and performance. I'm eager to discuss this project and explore how my skills can contribute to your team's success.",
